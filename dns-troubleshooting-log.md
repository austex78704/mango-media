# DNS Troubleshooting Log - Mango Media

## Issue Summary (June 22, 2025)
**Problem**: mangomedia.com not resolving despite successful AWS deployment and GoDaddy nameserver configuration.

## Symptoms
- ✅ AWS infrastructure deployed successfully via CloudFormation
- ✅ GoDaddy nameservers updated to Route53 values
- ❌ 0% DNS propagation after 6+ hours
- ❌ Direct nameserver queries return "No answer"

## Investigation Results

### DNS Query Tests
```bash
# Direct AWS nameserver query - FAILED
nslookup mangomedia.com ns-1815.awsdns-34.co.uk
# Result: "Can't find mangomedia.com: No answer"

# Current nameservers check - PASSED
nslookup -type=NS mangomedia.com
# Result: Shows correct AWS nameservers
```

### Root Cause Identified
**Multiple Route53 Hosted Zones**: AWS Console shows 3 separate hosted zones for mangomedia.com:
- Zone 1: Z058907250880...
- Zone 2: Z069717929Z7F...  
- Zone 3: Z097741615NQ5...

### Current Nameservers in GoDaddy
- ns-1815.awsdns-34.co.uk
- ns-1032.awsdns-01.org
- ns-366.awsdns-45.com
- ns-970.awsdns-57.net

## Technical Analysis
- Each hosted zone generates unique nameservers
- GoDaddy points to one set of nameservers
- DNS records (A, CNAME) exist in different zone
- Creates DNS resolution failure

## Resolution Steps Required
1. **Identify Active Zone**: Check which hosted zone contains CloudFront A records
2. **Verify Nameservers**: Ensure GoDaddy nameservers match the active zone
3. **Clean Up**: Delete empty/duplicate hosted zones
4. **Update if Needed**: If nameservers don't match, update GoDaddy

## Files Modified
- `project-summary.md`: Updated with troubleshooting status
- This log created for detailed issue tracking

## Resolution Actions Completed (June 23, 2025)
- [x] **Identified duplicate zones**: Found 3 hosted zones for mangomedia.com
- [x] **Cleaned up duplicates**: Removed 2 empty hosted zones, retained 1 active
- [x] **Created missing A records**: Added A records for mangomedia.com and www.mangomedia.com
- [x] **Updated GoDaddy nameservers**: Changed from old to current Route53 nameservers
- [x] **Verified configuration**: Route53 and GoDaddy now synchronized

## Final Configuration
- **Active Hosted Zone**: Single zone with proper A records
- **A Record**: mangomedia.com → ALIAS d27nt2zt9xxv8c.cloudfront.net
- **WWW Record**: www.mangomedia.com → ALIAS d27nt2zt9xxv8c.cloudfront.net
- **Nameservers in GoDaddy**: ns-407.awsdns-50.com, ns-1719.awsdns-22.co.uk, ns-651.awsdns-17.net, ns-1216.awsdns-24.org

## DNS Propagation Status
- **Nameserver propagation**: ✅ Confirmed propagating globally
- **A record resolution**: ⏳ Pending (normal for new records)
- **Expected timeline**: 15 minutes - 48 hours for full propagation
- **Monitor at**: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/mangomedia.com

## Complete Architecture Resolution (June 23, 2025 - Final Update)

### Root Cause Analysis Completed
**Original Issue**: Incremental deployment approach led to incomplete infrastructure
- Multiple failed CloudFormation stacks (6 total)
- Missing S3 bucket with website files  
- Misconfigured CloudFront origin access
- DNS records pointing to non-functional infrastructure

### Comprehensive Solution Implemented
**Phase 1**: Infrastructure cleanup - All failed CloudFormation stacks deleted
**Phase 2**: S3 bucket verification - `mangomedia-website-simple` contains all website files
**Phase 3**: CloudFront security - Origin Access Control (OAC) configured with proper S3 bucket policy
**Phase 4**: DNS alignment - Route53 and GoDaddy nameservers synchronized
**Phase 5**: SSL integration - Certificate Manager certificate properly attached

### Final Technical Architecture
```
User Request (mangomedia.com)
    ↓
GoDaddy DNS (Route53 nameservers)
    ↓  
Route53 (A record → CloudFront)
    ↓
CloudFront Distribution (SSL + Custom Domain)
    ↓
Origin Access Control (mangomedia-oac)
    ↓
S3 Bucket (mangomedia-website-simple)
    ↓
Website Files (index.html + assets)
```

### Lessons Learned
1. **Complete Planning Required**: All AWS components should be planned upfront
2. **End-to-End Testing**: Each component must be verified before proceeding
3. **Security First**: OAC > Public bucket access for production websites
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: CloudFormation templates need thorough testing
