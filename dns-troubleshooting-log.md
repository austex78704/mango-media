# DNS Troubleshooting Log - Mango Media

## Issue Summary (June 22, 2025)
**Problem**: mangomedia.com not resolving despite successful AWS deployment and GoDaddy nameserver configuration.

## Symptoms
- ✅ AWS infrastructure deployed successfully via CloudFormation
- ✅ GoDaddy nameservers updated to Route53 values
- ❌ 0% DNS propagation after 6+ hours
- ❌ Direct nameserver queries return "No answer"

## Investigation Results

### DNS Query Tests
```bash
# Direct AWS nameserver query - FAILED
nslookup mangomedia.com ns-1815.awsdns-34.co.uk
# Result: "Can't find mangomedia.com: No answer"

# Current nameservers check - PASSED
nslookup -type=NS mangomedia.com
# Result: Shows correct AWS nameservers
```

### Root Cause Identified
**Multiple Route53 Hosted Zones**: AWS Console shows 3 separate hosted zones for mangomedia.com:
- Zone 1: Z058907250880...
- Zone 2: Z069717929Z7F...  
- Zone 3: Z097741615NQ5...

### Current Nameservers in GoDaddy
- ns-1815.awsdns-34.co.uk
- ns-1032.awsdns-01.org
- ns-366.awsdns-45.com
- ns-970.awsdns-57.net

## Technical Analysis
- Each hosted zone generates unique nameservers
- GoDaddy points to one set of nameservers
- DNS records (A, CNAME) exist in different zone
- Creates DNS resolution failure

## Resolution Steps Required
1. **Identify Active Zone**: Check which hosted zone contains CloudFront A records
2. **Verify Nameservers**: Ensure GoDaddy nameservers match the active zone
3. **Clean Up**: Delete empty/duplicate hosted zones
4. **Update if Needed**: If nameservers don't match, update GoDaddy
