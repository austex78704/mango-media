## 🎉 Deployment Summary

### Infrastructure Deployment (Completed June 22, 2025)
1. ✅ **Deploy Infrastructure**: GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
2. ✅ **Configure Domain**: GoDaddy nameservers updated to Route53
   - Route53 Nameservers: 
     - ns-1815.awsdns-34.co.uk
     - ns-1032.awsdns-01.org
     - ns-366.awsdns-45.com
     - ns-970.awsdns-57.net
3. 🔄 **DNS Propagation**: Currently in progress (up to 48 hours)
4. ⏳ **Test Website**: Verify https://mangomedia.com loads correctly
5. ⏳ **Monitor Performance**: Check CloudFront metrics and S3 usage

### Troubleshooting Notes
- **CloudFormation DELETE_FAILED Issue**: Resolved by implementing timestamp-based stack names
- **Deployment Strategy**: Used dynamic stack naming to avoid conflicts with stuck stacks
- **Final Stack**: Successfully deployed using timestamp-based approach
- **DNS Resolution Issue (June 22, 2025)**: 
  - Discovered 3 duplicate Route53 hosted zones for mangomedia.com
  - Causing DNS conflicts and zero propagation
  - All zones have same domain name but different zone IDs
  - Nameservers correctly set in GoDaddy but pointing to wrong/empty zone
  - **Resolution Required**: Identify active zone with CloudFront records, delete duplicates
